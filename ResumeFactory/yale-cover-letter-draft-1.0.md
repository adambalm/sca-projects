# Cover Letter - Yale Digital Content and Chatbot Manager
## Draft 1.0

---

Dear Hiring Committee,

I'm currently implementing AI governance frameworks at Springfield Commonwealth Academy and training faculty on how to use LLMs effectively—prompt engineering, context management, understanding when these tools are reliable and when they're not. We've achieved real adoption: science and ESL teachers are using NotebookLM for note organization and quiz generation. I've also identified workflow automation opportunities that have reduced grade notification processes from a week to a day.

That work is directly relevant to Yale's Finance chatbot challenge. The technical part—structured content, metadata, retrieval optimization—I've been doing for 20 years. The newer part is understanding how LLMs consume and use that content, and how to train people to work effectively with these systems.

At UMass, I taught Finance to organize audit documents using metadata and structure. At Western New England University, I managed content governance and trained hundreds of authors on standards and workflows. The principle has always been the same: information architecture that serves human understanding also serves machine retrieval. What's changed is that the machines are now sophisticated enough to make that investment pay off in ways that weren't possible before.

Yale's chatbot needs well-organized source content, clear governance, and continuous improvement based on performance data. That requires someone who understands content structure, knows how to work with stakeholders across an institution, and can evaluate what's working through testing and user feedback. I've been doing that work in higher education for two decades.

I have deep connections to New Haven and would welcome the opportunity to return to the area. I'd appreciate the chance to discuss how my experience translates to what Yale is building.
